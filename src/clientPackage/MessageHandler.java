 * This class is intented do message handling and is only used in a static context
 * Every time the listener thread receives a new message the method inside this class 
 * is called to identify the message type and to decide how to react or what to do with
 * the data insided the newly received message.
 * 
 * This class was mainly introduced to outsource the message handling and not to overload other classes
 * since the handleMessage() Method is relatively long and was freqently extended during development
